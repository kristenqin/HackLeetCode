	- Planning is an essential part of software development
		- Solving many problems during practice and in real interviews, I have quickly realized that coding is only a part of the process and writing a solution immediately after reading the prompt is probably the worst mistake one can make.[^1]
		- Not only that, before writing the actual code you should suggest a solution, analyze its strength and drawbacks, and only start coding when everyone has agreed that what you have proposed is acceptable.
		- For example, I started to notice patterns for solving certain types of problems, because of OJ (online judge), I care a lot about writing bug free code (I even check spelling mistakes before submission), and plus I became ==very efficient in using Python libs/functions, which greatly improved my coding speed (I'll have to look up the reference before)==.[^4]
	- How to start[^6]
		- Follow a list[^9]
		- Start from easiest to hardest. You can start skipping questions if you feel like the problems are getting too easy for you.
		- Start with problems that have an editorial already written. These are the ones with a little "document page" icon in the "Solution" column of the problem set. As an exercise to the reader, you could re-purpose the script above to filter only for problems that ==have a per-written editorial==.
		- start with problems that have good reviews. While LeetCode is a pretty great platform, not all problems are created equal. If you open a problem, you can see how many people upvoted or downvoted a problem. I'd initially stay away from problems that ==have a worse than 2:1 ratio of upvotes to downvotes==, and problems that ==have 4:1 or above are usually of fairly high quality==. It's much easier to learn from the higher-rated problems.
	- How to get un-stuck[^7]
		- First, if there is an ==editorial already written for the problem, start with that==. These tend to be fairly high-quality and often include a well-written code solution.
		- Next, open the "Discuss" tab for the problem, and read some of the posts. These ==vary wildly in quality==: some people just post a solution; others go into great detail. Your mileage may vary here, but this is also often a helpful resource if you get stuck.
		- Finally, you can ==Google the problem itself==, and oftentimes other people will have posted solutions or written about it on third-party sites, like their personal blog or Github repo.
	- How to refine
		- If you feel weaker in a certain algorithm, you can ==filter the problem set by "Tag"==.This is NOT recommended for general practice, since much of the actual problem-solving skill you want to have is ==the ability to identify the type of algorithm to solve a problem==.
		- Go through some older problems, and make sure that you have found the optimal solution.
		- The weekly contests are a great way to see where you stack up against the rest of the community. 
		- This is new and not available several years ago, but the new Mock Interview is actually really good for adding some ==time pressure==. 
	- Steps for solving problems[^10]
		- Step 1: Reading the Problem Very Very Closely
			- Highlight the areas of the problems you think are important. 
			- Note down what phrases you think are important.
			- what data structures/algorithms they might be hinting towards. 
				`We can also see if you tend to think of certain structures many times (I had a student who thought on tries anytime a string problem came up`
		- Step 2: Working on the problem
			- While working on the problem I recommend thinking out loud. This gets you in the idea of communicating your ideas while solving a problem. 
		- Step 3: Review the solution
			- Remember all the thinking you did in Step 1
				- This is where it comes into play.
				- Look at the solution. 
				- What kind of data structures did they use. 
				- Was there a specific algorithm that you missed? 
				- Was there something that could have hinted at the steps they used? 
				- At what points did the solution diverge from what you had in mind?
		- Step 4: Alternative Solutions
			- However, it can be the difference between an almost and a yes in the decision making process.
				- Could we reduce the space usage (even if time complexity goes up)? 
				- Can we use other data structures/ frame the question in another way? 
				- What other ways could we solve it?
	- Discussion on the meaning of using Leetcode as an interviewing tool[^11]
		- 1
			- Leetcode isn't about fun and challenging things, it's about thinking in one particular way, spitting out solutions using the same exact data structures and jumping through hoops on command without philosophizing or creating anything that can be reused/extended.
			- This is also what Software Engineering has become: you memorize, regurgitate and participate in agile the masquerade. Creativity is shunned. Tried architectures/patterns are what is expected.
		- 2
			- It's fun if you enjoy programming and algorithms, in my opinion. If you cannot sit down and learn like that then it is possible that you don't have the sort of mindset that the companies who are employing these tests are looking for.
		- 3
			- Also, I've been programming for over 10 years. I personally know two ex-lawyers who switched to programming and are much happier. I've never met anybody switching from programming to law.
		- 4
			- Myself I think people might have most problems with dynamic programming as this type of optimization solutions aren't popular in normal programming. Also geometry or number theory puzzles can also be weird. Also tons of these problems are underspecified or just plain wrong, which made me sad sometimes.
			- They want low buss factor and good profit margin and not programming stars. The bright side is you work 9-5 for good salary. Just need correct attitude (I am so inclined to quote hustlers here ;). Express your creativity by paiting, dancing or writing poem and you will be better off and happier.

			- Personal anecdote:
				- The best coder I’ve come across in my career once told me he attempted to solve some leetcode and was stuck fairly early and gave up. I was surprised to hear that he even cared to try.
				- What made him a fantastic engineer was his meticulous work ethic, his track record of never having missed a deadline, him spending 40% of his time designing before he even wrote a single line of code, writing extremely human readable code, his obsession with unambiguous and simple APIs and his extensive unit testing.
				- He was humble, loved to crack jokes and was always fun to solve hard problems with.
				- None of that is captured by leetcode. This is probably my personal bias - but the only people who work hard at leetcode are people who want to prove something to the world. I’d rather work with people who like the profession and don’t feel compelled to prove anything.
			- Learning Theory
				- It misses the key idea that the main factor is the person not taking the bike seriously as if he actually decided to take the time to learn how to ride a bike, it's virtually certain he would be better at it than 90% of people because the underlying traits that make one exceptional at running would also make one good at biking.
				- It also sounds this person had a good temperament and personality which worked in his favor. That wouldn't matter though if he didn't have the cognitive ability to never miss deadlines and correctly design out code in his head and on paper before writing it as you say.
			- About finding job
				- You seem to be suffering, so I don't want to pile on, but it seems kind of crazy to me to spend 5 years on a particular approach to getting a job. 
					- Is there something else that's limiting you? 
					- Hard-to-understand accent? 
					- Language Skills? 
					- Social skills? 
					- Resume typos/grammar? 
					- Contact list? 
					- Trying for jobs that are out of reach, when other satisfactory jobs could be in reach?
				- There are two paths into FAANG entry-level jobs:
					- Graduate from a top school
					- Work at non-FAANG companies for several years and develop strong software engineering skills: 
						- attention to detail, 
						- deep knowledge of one language, 
						- writing and maintaining unit tests and integration tests, 
						- giving and receiving code reviews, 
						- being oncall, 
						- sitting in on requirements meetings with customers, 
						- spending months implementing features, 
						- seeing some of them fail in production or fail with users, 
						- and deploying and owning a small service and being the go-to person on the team for it. 
						- This takes several years. 
						- 
						- Almost nobody can get a FAANG job without this experience. Grinding leetcode is something to do for 2-3 weeks before your FAANG interview to brush up on algorithms. Leetcode cannot give you software engineering experience that FAANG interviewers look for.

	- About Leetcode Grind[^12]
		- Some related communites
			- Rather, it refers to a range of platforms—including Hackerrank, Geeksforgeeks, CodeChef, and more—that are meant to help you practice solving technical interview problems and coding puzzles.
			- Due to how frequently these types of questions are asked during technical interviews, certain online circles—especially subreddits like ==r/cscareerquestions==—have come to develop an almost religious obsession with the so-called "Leetcode grind." 
		- Phenomena
			- Decide that you're going to finally tackle Leetcode.
			- Get stuck on an Easy problem.
			- Give up 10 minutes in and look at the solution.
			- Fail to understand said solution.
			- Google "Leetcode sucks" and read some encouraging rants on Reddit.
			- Revisit step 1 about a month later.
		- Suggestions
			- 1. Don't always filter problems by subject
			- 2. If you're stuck, attempt a brute-force solution
			- 3. Don't treat Leetcode as a competition
			- 4. Use the language you want to use on the job
			- 5. Don't beat yourself up
	- About notetaking method
		- About Pythonic pseudo-code[^15] [^16]
		- writing things down in your own words let's you check if you understand something and reinforces it.
	- Pseudocode[^17]
		- Advantages of Pseudocode
			- readability
			- between the program and the algorithm or flowchart
			- works as a rough documentation
			- making the code construction phase easier
		- How to write a Pseudo-code?![[Pasted image 20220721180927.png|100]][^18]
			- Arrange the sequence of tasks and write the pseudocode accordingly. establishes the main goal or the aim.
				- This program will allow the user to check the number whether it's even or odd.
				-  if-else, for, while loops are indented in a program
				- appropriate naming conventions
				- appropriate sentence casings
				- Elaborate everything which is going to happen in the actual code. Don’t make the pseudo code abstract.
				- standard programming structures such as ‘if-then’, ‘for’, ‘while’, ‘cases’ the way we use it in programming.
				- Check whether all the sections of a pseudo code is complete, finite and clear to understand and comprehend.
				- Don’t write the pseudo code in a complete programmatic manner.

	- What's your favourite note-taking app whilst learning to program?[^22]
		- But general advice from Barbara Oakley per other research suggests that immersing yourself in a lecture is more important than focusing on note-taking.

			- Good stuff! I’ve recently give across ==Codewars== and personally prefer its platform. [^5]
	- 优质教材
		- I also strongly recommend "==Cracking the Coding Interview==". Many of those problems are also available on LeetCode, so you can actually use LeetCode as a complementary tool alongside the book. [^8]
